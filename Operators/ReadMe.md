We are being asked about the (...) syntax in JavaScript. This is a common operator that serves two main purposes: as the spread operator and as the rest parameter. 
1. **Spread Operator**: 
   - Used to expand an iterable (like an array, string, or object) into individual elements.
   - Common in array literals, function calls, and object literals

2. **Rest Parameter**:
   - Used in function definitions to collect all the remaining arguments into an array.
   - Allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
   Example:
   ```javascript
   function logArguments(first, ...rest) {
     console.log(first); // first argument
     console.log(rest);  // array of the rest of the arguments
   }
   logArguments(1, 2, 3, 4); 
   // Output: 
   // 1
   // [2, 3, 4]
